## Log Entry: 2025-07-02

### Implemented Features:
- **Interactive Mode Tool Confirmation:** Modified `commands/interactive.js` to prompt the user for confirmation before executing any tool suggested by the AI model. This allows the user to review the tool and its arguments.
- **New Tools Added:** Integrated the following new tools into `lib/tools.js`:
    - `decode_jwt`: Decodes a given JWT token.
    - `convert_currency`: Converts an amount from one currency to another using an external API.
    - `send_notification`: Sends a desktop notification using `node-notifier`.

### Dependencies:
- Noted the need to install `jsonwebtoken` and `node-notifier` (which you confirmed are already installed).

### Session Persistence:
- Discussed methods for session persistence, including `save_memory` for user-specific facts and project-specific configuration files (e.g., `GEMINI.md`).
- Agreed to implement automatic logging of significant changes to `.gemini_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_log.md` for project-specific context.

### Bug Fixes:
- **Interactive Command Not Found:** Added the `interactive` command to `lib/commands.js` to ensure it's properly registered with Commander. This resolves the "unknown command 'interactive'" error.
- **SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'jwt'**: Moved `jsonwebtoken` and `node-notifier` imports to the top of `lib/tools.js` and changed them to `import * as ... from ...` to correctly handle CommonJS modules in an ES module environment.
- **SyntaxError: Unexpected token '*'**: Removed duplicated code block in `lib/tools.js` that was causing the syntax error.
- **TypeError: program.command is not a function**: Reverted `lib/commands.js` to remove `interactive` from `commandRegistry` and directly registered the `interactive` command in `index.js` to ensure proper Commander initialization.

### Enhancements:
- **Currency Conversion Tool Improvement:** Modified `lib/tools.js` to make the `amount` parameter optional in `convert_currency` tool declaration and function, defaulting to 1. This allows the model to fetch exchange rates even when no specific amount is provided in the prompt.
- **Improved Tool Calling for Currency Conversion:**
    - Simplified the `systemInstruction` in `commands/interactive.js` to be more general about tool usage.
    - Added a clear example to the `description` of the `convert_currency` tool in `lib/tools.js` to guide the model on how to use it for rate lookups.
